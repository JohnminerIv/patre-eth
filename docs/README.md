This application is primarily user oriented by design. It makes sense to start
Making this application with a user sign up, login, logout workflow in mind.

As such, we will create routs and pages in this order:

1. homepage at /
2. user sign up at /user/create
3. user login at /user/login
4. user logout at /user/:id/logout
5. user update at /user/:id/update
6. user delete at /user/:id/delete
